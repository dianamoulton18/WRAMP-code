        A <b> pie chart </b>is a circular graph that is split into several slices, like a fraction, to represent a
        proportion in a data.<br><br /> For example, the pie chart above shows a proportion of 1/4 or (25%) where 25%
        for the graphics is colored in darker purple. <br>
        <br> Proportions and percentages are also used to describe chances. For example, there is 25% of chance of
        raining tomorrow. However, people usually use expressions like "likely", "probably"
        when they talk about probabilities and chances.For example, "It will likely rain tomorrow", "There is only a
        little chance that I'll travel to Paris again" etc...

        <br> <br> In this study, <b> we are interested in the words and expressions that people use to describe
            probabilities shown in a data visualization like a pie chart. </b>

        <br> <br> For this experiment, imagine yourself participating in a game where you have to pick a marble from a
        set at random. Some of the marbles are pink, and some of them are purple. The game has two outcomes: <br>
        - If you pull a purple marble, you win. <br>
        - If you pull a pink marble, you lose.<br>
        <br> In the pie chart provided above, the purple section of the graph represents the proportion of purple
        marbles in the set. A quarter of the total number of marbles in the set is purple.

        <br> In general, the bigger the purple slice is, the more purple marbles there are in the set. Your chance of
        picking one and winning the game will vary accordingly.

        <br> <br> <b>Your task: </b> For each question in this questionnaire, observe the visualization and describe
        your chance of picking a purple marble and winning the game.
        <br> Do <b>NOT</b> use numerical answer like<i> "The chance of drawing a purple marble is 25%"</i>. Instead, use
        familiar probability words and expressions to describe and communicate your chances.
        <br> <br>
        Since this is a scientific experiment, your answers could be rejected if they do not follow these instructions
